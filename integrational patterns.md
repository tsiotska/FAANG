1. Shared Memory
   Description: Multiple systems or applications access a common memory space for data exchange.
   Use Case: Low-latency communication between tightly coupled systems where high-speed data sharing is required.
   Pros: Fast access and response time.
   Cons: Can lead to synchronization issues like race conditions and is difficult to scale across distributed systems.
2. RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
   Description: A method where one system invokes a function on another system, as if it were a local function.
   Use Case: Synchronous communication where real-time response from another system is required.
   Pros: Simple and intuitive.
   Cons: Tightly coupled; failure in one system affects the other. Network latency can impact performance.
3. Point-to-Point
   Description: Direct communication between two systems, often using a network protocol.
   Use Case: One-to-one, direct connection between systems, such as client-server architectures.
   Pros: Simple and efficient for basic use cases.
   Cons: Difficult to manage and scale as more systems are added (n*n connections).
4. Queue
   Description: Messages are placed into a queue by a producer and processed by consumers in an asynchronous manner.
   Use Case: Asynchronous messaging when systems do not need to respond immediately.
   Pros: Decouples systems, ensuring resilience and reliability.
   Cons: Introduces latency and complexity in managing queue sizes and message delivery guarantees.
5. Message Broker
   Description: A middleman system that routes messages between systems based on defined rules or topics.
   Use Case: Managing communication between loosely coupled systems, enabling scalability and flexibility.
   Pros: Provides filtering, routing, and decoupling between systems.
   Cons: Adds a layer of complexity and potential bottlenecks if not managed well.
6. Service Bus
   Description: A central hub that allows different services to communicate with each other using a standardized protocol.
   Use Case: Enterprise systems where multiple services need to interact in a loosely coupled way.
   Pros: Promotes reusability, flexibility, and easy integration of services.
   Cons: Can become a single point of failure and a performance bottleneck if not optimized.
7. Workflow
   Description: An orchestrated sequence of tasks or steps that different systems follow to achieve a business goal.
   Use Case: Automation of business processes where different systems need to interact in a defined order.
   Pros: Ensures process consistency and automation.
   Cons: Can become rigid and complex to manage as processes grow.
8. Shared Database
   Description: Different systems access the same database to exchange or retrieve data.
   Use Case: Systems needing access to the same source of data in real-time.
   Pros: Simplifies data access and ensures a single source of truth.
   Cons: Can lead to contention issues, data integrity concerns, and performance bottlenecks.
9. Data Copy
   Description: Data is periodically copied between systems, often in a batch or ETL process.
   Use Case: Systems that need periodic data synchronization but don't require real-time data exchange.
   Pros: Allows for decoupling and ensures data is available across systems.
   Cons: Can lead to data inconsistencies if not managed properly and introduces latency in data availability.
10. Functional Integration
    Description: Integration is done at a higher level, where functions or services from one system are embedded into another system's workflow.
    Use Case: When reusing business functions across multiple systems.
    Pros: Promotes reuse and consistency across systems.
    Cons: Can lead to tighter coupling of systems and versioning issues.
11. Service Integration
    Description: Systems communicate via well-defined services (usually using APIs), typically through REST or SOAP protocols.
    Use Case: Loose coupling of systems through APIs to allow for scalability and service reuse.
    Pros: Promotes flexibility, reuse, and easy maintainability.
    Cons: Performance overhead from service communication and the complexity of managing many services.
